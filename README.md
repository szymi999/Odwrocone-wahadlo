# Inverted pendulum

A project for college in which I implemented an inverted pendulum simulation based on the nonlinear dynamics equation.

Opis problemu, treść zadania:

The task was to implement an inverted pendulum simulator based on the nonlinear dynamics equation, which allowed me to study the response of the pendulum to a given signal. I used the Python language for this.
I created an interface that allows you to change parameters such as:
ω - initial angle
τ - the driving torque of the motor, i.e. the amplitude of the signal
b - coefficient of viscous friction
m - mass of the pendulum
L - length of the pendulum
Input signal - sine, rectangular or triangular signal and its parameters(signal period, filling for rectangular, duration)

Also I made diagrams showing the appearance of both the input and output of the circuit. And a simple simulation is implemented showing the behavior of the pendulum itself.
